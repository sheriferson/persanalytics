## keystroke data ##
<a id="keystrokes"></a>

Here is a general plot of the count of minutes with keystroke recordings on my Airspace machine.

### Split by machine ###

However, I actually own two computers, **Airspace** is my home/desktop machine (17" laptop connected to a Thunderbolt display), and **Shuttle** is the machine I take to campus and elsewhere. Back when **Airspace** was my only machine, I used to take it to campus and use it at home, which explains why it has more keystroke data than **Shuttle** does:

The plots are not that nice gives the disparity between **Airspace** and **Shuttle**. That said, one can see that Sundays are the days I use **Airspace** the most, and **Shuttle** the least. So are evening hours very **Airspace**-heavy and **Shuttle**-light.

What can I do to get a better view of recent data? Maybe I can look at data collected since 2014.

What about the distribution of my keystrokes throughout the day?
